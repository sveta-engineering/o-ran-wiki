# Tutorial structure

## How is the tutorial structured?

Each lesson covers 1 aspect of Zephyr. The order of lessons is chosen deliberately, unless you already know a thing or two, it is recommended to not skip ahead.

Each lesson consist of 4 parts:
- **Introduction**: introduce each new topic/concept, explain why it is useful.
- **Commands**: go over all the commands/api calls that are relevant to that particular topic.
- **Kconfig**: here we take a look at the different Kconfig settings that might be interesting.
- **Examples**: some examples to show how to apply the discussed concepts.
