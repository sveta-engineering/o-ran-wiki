# Zephyr: Tutorial for Beginners

A step-by-step guide that teaches you how to use Zephyr RTOS. It assumes:
- knowledge of C
- no previous experience with RTOS
- basic embedded electronics knowledge (GPIO, Timers, Interrupt,...)

Each lesson builds on the previous one. Most lessons end with exercises (with solutions!) that show how the covered concepts can be used in a practical application.
